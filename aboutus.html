    <p class="robb">Rob Edwards founded the company in 2020. He has always had a passion for old trucks and has loved them ever since he was a kid. He does lots of the work on them himself and takes pride in what trucks roll on and off his lot. He has a great taste for classic trucks and puts his heart and sould into each one that goes in and out of the shop. Aside from Robs basic mechanical skills he uses his mechanic of 20+ years, Raymond Motors to perfect these classic finds. </p>
